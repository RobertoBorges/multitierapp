# Application Assessment Report

## BookShop Application Migration to Azure

### Overview

This report provides an assessment of the BookShop application for migration to Azure. It includes analysis of the current application structure, dependencies, and recommendations for modernization and cloud migration.

### Application Details

**Project Name:** BookShop  
**Type:** Multi-tier .NET Web Application  
**Current Framework:** .NET Framework 3.5  
**Target Framework:** Pending user input  
**Database:** SQL Server 2008  
**Application Pattern:** ASP.NET Web Forms

### Application Structure

The BookShop application follows a traditional multi-tier architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**
   - BookShop.Web - Main customer-facing website
   - BookShop.Admin - Administrative interface

2. **Business Logic Layer**
   - BookShop.BusinessLogic - Contains service classes for business operations

3. **Data Access Layer**
   - BookShop.DataAccess - Contains repositories for data operations

4. **Common Layer**
   - BookShop.Common - Contains shared models and utilities

### Dependencies

Full dependency analysis will be completed during Phase 2. Currently identified:

- .NET Framework (version to be confirmed)
- SQL Server
- ASP.NET Web Forms

### Migration Requirements

Based on user input, the following migration requirements have been defined:

- **Target .NET Version**: .NET 8
- **Preferred Azure Hosting**: Azure App Service
- **Database**: Existing Azure SQL Database (migration from SQL Server 2008)
- **IaC Tool**: Azure Bicep
- **Authentication**: Migrate from Windows Authentication to Entra ID (Azure AD)
- **Timeline**: ASAP - high priority migration

### Migration Strategy

Based on the requirements and initial analysis, the following migration approach is proposed:

1. **Assessment Phase**
   - Detailed code analysis
   - Dependency mapping
   - Identification of modernization points
   - Database schema compatibility assessment

2. **Code Modernization Phase**
   - Migrate from .NET Framework 3.5 to .NET 8
   - Replace Web Forms with ASP.NET Core MVC (specifically not Razor Pages)
   - Migrate all static assets (images in /images/books/, CSS files, etc.) to MVC structure
   - Convert custom data access layer to Entity Framework Core
   - Replace web.config with appsettings.json
   - Implement dependency injection
   - Integrate Entra ID authentication
   - Update database connection for Azure SQL

3. **Infrastructure Preparation Phase**
   - Create Azure Bicep templates for all required resources
   - Configure networking and security settings
   - Set up Entra ID integration
   - Prepare Azure SQL database connection
   - Create IaC templates for Azure resources
   - Set up networking and security
   - Configure database migration

4. **Deployment Phase**
   - Deploy to Azure
   - Validate functionality
   - Performance testing

5. **CI/CD Implementation Phase**
   - Set up automated deployment pipelines

### Next Steps

Proceed to Phase 2 - Application Assessment with the following priorities:

- Conduct detailed compatibility analysis between .NET Framework 3.5 and .NET 8
- Identify all Web Forms components and plan their conversion to ASP.NET Core MVC
- Create inventory of all static assets (including book images in /images/books/) for migration
- Analyze the existing data access layer for conversion to Entity Framework Core
- Determine exact Azure SQL database compatibility requirements
- Plan Entra ID authentication integration approach
- Develop detailed project timeline to meet ASAP requirements
- Create risk mitigation strategies for accelerated migration
- Begin Azure Bicep template development for infrastructure
- Set up Entra ID application registration for authentication

### Key Migration Challenges

Based on the requirements and initial analysis, these are the key challenges to address:

1. **Framework Upgrade** - Large version gap from .NET Framework 3.5 to .NET 8
2. **UI Paradigm Change** - Web Forms to ASP.NET Core MVC transition (including static assets)
3. **Data Access Modernization** - Custom repositories to Entity Framework Core
4. **Configuration Changes** - web.config to appsettings.json
5. **Database Compatibility** - Connect to existing Azure SQL Database
6. **Authentication & Authorization** - Migrate from Windows authentication to Entra ID
7. **Azure App Service Deployment** - Configure and optimize for App Service hosting
8. **Time Constraints** - Accelerated timeline requires efficient execution

### High-Level Migration Roadmap

Given the ASAP timeline requirement, here is an accelerated migration roadmap:

| Week | Phase | Key Activities |
|------|-------|---------------|
| Week 1 | Assessment | Complete detailed assessment, inventory all components, finalize migration plan |
| Week 2 | Code Modernization (Part 1) | Convert project structure to .NET 8, update basic models and shared components |
| Week 3 | Code Modernization (Part 2) | Convert Web Forms to ASP.NET Core MVC, migrate static assets (images, CSS), implement Entra ID authentication |
| Week 4 | Code Modernization (Part 3) | Convert data access layer to EF Core, finalize Azure SQL integration |
| Week 5 | Infrastructure & Deployment | Set up Azure App Service, deploy application, perform initial testing |
| Week 6 | Testing & Optimization | Comprehensive testing, performance optimization, security validation |
| Week 7 | CI/CD & Production | Set up CI/CD pipeline, final production deployment, knowledge transfer |

### Static Asset Migration Plan

A special focus will be placed on static asset migration:

1. **Book Images**
   - All book cover images in `/images/books/` directory will be migrated to the appropriate location in the ASP.NET Core MVC structure (`wwwroot/images/books/`)
   - Image references in code will be updated to use the ASP.NET Core static file handling
   - Image optimization may be performed during migration

2. **CSS and JavaScript**
   - CSS files in `/css/` will be migrated to the MVC `wwwroot/css/` directory
   - JavaScript files will be modernized where necessary and placed in `wwwroot/js/`
   - Consider implementing a modern front-end asset pipeline using npm/webpack if appropriate

3. **URL Structure**
   - Maintain consistent URL patterns where possible
   - Implement URL rewriting rules for changed paths to avoid broken links
   - Set up proper HTTP redirects for critical changed endpoints

_Note: This is a preliminary assessment and roadmap. Detailed assessment will be completed during Phase 2._
