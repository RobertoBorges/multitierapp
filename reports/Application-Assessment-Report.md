| User Management | None | Microsoft.Identity.Web |

### Data Access Assessment

#### Current Data Access Pattern

The application uses a custom repository pattern with ADO.NET for database access:

1. **Connection Management**:
   - Connection strings stored in web.config
   - Manual connection management with `using` statements
   - No connection pooling optimizations

2. **Query Execution**:
   - Raw SQL queries embedded in repository methods
   - Manual parameter creation with SqlParameter
   - Manual SQL injection prevention

3. **Data Mapping**:
   - Manual mapping from DataTable/DataReader to domain objects
   - No ORM or automated mapping
   - Custom helper methods in repositories

4. **Transaction Handling**:
   - Minimal transaction support
   - No distributed transaction capabilities

#### Database Structure

Based on the SQL scripts, the database contains the following tables:

1. **Books**: Main product table with book details
2. **Authors**: Author information
3. **Categories**: Book categories/genres
4. **Orders**: Customer order information
5. **OrderItems**: Individual items in orders
6. **Customers**: Customer account information
7. **Employees**: Staff accounts (likely for admin access)

#### Azure SQL Compatibility

Key considerations for working with the existing Azure SQL Database:

1. **Connection String**: Will use the existing Azure SQL Database connection string
2. **Schema Preservation**: Will use the existing database schema without modifications
3. **Entity Framework Integration**: Will use EF Core database-first approach with existing tables
4. **Security**: Need to implement Entra ID authentication for database access
5. **Connection Resiliency**: Need to add retry logic for cloud connectivity

### Migration Strategy & Recommendations

Based on the detailed assessment, the following migration strategy and recommendations are proposed:

#### 1. Project Structure Modernization

**Current Structure:**
- Separate Web Forms projects (BookShop.Web and BookShop.Admin)
- Class library projects for business logic and data access
- Tight coupling between layers

**Recommended Approach:**
- Create a new ASP.NET Core MVC project with .NET 8
- Implement a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:
  - **BookShop.Web**: ASP.NET Core MVC application
  - **BookShop.Core**: Domain models and business logic interfaces
  - **BookShop.Infrastructure**: Data access and external services
  - **BookShop.Application**: Application services and use cases

#### 2. UI Migration (Web Forms to MVC)

**Current UI Framework:**
- ASP.NET Web Forms with postbacks
- Server controls (GridView, Repeater)
- Master pages for layout

**Recommended Approach:**
- Convert master pages to _Layout.cshtml
- Convert Web Forms to MVC controllers and Razor views
- Replace server controls with tag helpers and view components
- Implement partial views for reusable components
- Use View Models for strongly typed views
- Static content migration:
  - Move all images to /wwwroot/images/books/
  - Move CSS to /wwwroot/css/
  - Maintain same filenames for compatibility

#### 3. Authentication Modernization

**Current Authentication:**
- Windows Authentication in admin area
- No authentication for public site

**Recommended Approach:**
- Implement Microsoft.Identity.Web for Entra ID integration
- Configure JWT Bearer authentication
- Implement role-based and policy-based authorization
- Create admin area with appropriate authorization policies
- Use App Service Easy Auth for additional security

#### 4. Data Access Modernization

**Current Data Access:**
- Raw ADO.NET with manual SQL queries
- Custom repository pattern
- Manual object mapping

**Recommended Approach:**
   - Implement Entity Framework Core with database-first approach
   - Connect directly to existing Azure SQL database schema
   - Use standard EF Core features without custom mapping code
   - Use async/await for all database operations
   - Configure connection resiliency for cloud database
   - Implement Entra ID authentication for database access
   - Preserve existing database schema and structure

#### 5. Infrastructure Modernization

**Current Infrastructure:**
- On-premises hosting
- No infrastructure as code
- Manual deployment process

**Recommended Approach:**
- Create Azure Bicep templates for:
  - App Service Plan and App Service
  - Azure SQL Database connection
  - Application Insights
  - Entra ID integration
- Implement secure configuration using Key Vault
- Set up proper networking and security
- Configure monitoring and logging

#### 6. Deployment and DevOps

**Current Process:**
- Manual deployment
- No CI/CD pipeline
- Limited testing

**Recommended Approach:**
- Set up GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
- Implement automated testing (unit, integration)
- Configure staged deployments (Dev/Test/Prod)
- Implement infrastructure validation
- Set up monitoring and alerts
- Configure backup and disaster recovery
