   - Evaluate cloud readiness
   - Create detailed assessment report

3. âœ… **Code Modernization**
   - âœ… Upgrade framework version (.NET 3.5 to .NET 8)
   - âœ… Modernize dependencies
   - âœ… Implement EF Core database-first approach with existing Azure SQL database
   - âœ… Refactor Web Forms to ASP.NET Core MVC (not Razor Pages)
   - âœ… Migrate static assets (images, CSS, JS) to MVC structure
   - âœ… Update authentication to Entra ID
   - âœ… Implement health checks and database initialization
   - âœ… Create EF Core migrations for database schema
   - âœ… Enhance application with rich sample data
   - âœ… Complete remaining views and test end-to-end functionality

4. âœ… **Infrastructure Generation**
   - âœ… Create Azure Bicep templates for App Service and related resources
   - âœ… Configure networking, security, and Entra ID integration
   - âœ… Set up Application Insights monitoring and logging
   - âœ… Implement disaster recovery and backup strategies

5. ðŸ”„ **Deployment to Azure** (Current Phase)
   - âœ… Create deployment scripts and automation
   - âœ… Develop validation and testing procedures

   - Implement testing in pipeline
   - Configure monitoring and alerts

### Risks and Mitigation

- **Large version gap from .NET Framework 3.5 to .NET 8**
  - Mitigation: Adopt a phased conversion approach with focus on core functionality first
  
- **Web Forms to ASP.NET Core MVC transition complexity**
  - Mitigation: Create reusable component patterns to accelerate UI conversion
  - Mitigation: Develop an asset migration strategy for all images and static content
  - Mitigation: Maintain URL structure where possible to avoid broken links
  
- **Integration with existing Azure SQL Database**
  - Mitigation: Use EF Core database-first approach with existing schema
  - Mitigation: Test connection and data access early in the development process
  
- **Windows to Entra ID authentication migration**
  - Mitigation: Use Microsoft.Identity.Web library for streamlined integration
  
- **Accelerated timeline (ASAP)**
  - Mitigation: Prioritize features, establish clear milestones, use parallel work streams
