### Risks and Mitigation

- **Large version gap from .NET Framework 3.5 to .NET 8**
  - Mitigation: Adopt a phased conversion approach with focus on core functionality first
  
- **Web Forms to ASP.NET Core MVC transition complexity**
  - Mitigation: Create reusable component patterns to accelerate UI conversion
  - Mitigation: Develop an asset migration strategy for all images and static content
  - Mitigation: Maintain URL structure where possible to avoid broken links
  
- **Integration with existing Azure SQL Database**
  - Mitigation: Use EF Core database-first approach with existing schema
  - Mitigation: Test connection and data access early in the development process
  
- **Windows to Entra ID authentication migration**
  - Mitigation: Use Microsoft.Identity.Web library for streamlined integration
  
- **Accelerated timeline (ASAP)**
  - Mitigation: Prioritize features, establish clear milestones, use parallel work streams
