# Migration Status Report

## Project: BookShop Application Migration to Azure

### Current Status

- **Phase**: Phase 1 - Planning
- **Started**: August 15, 2025
- **Status**: In Progress

### Completed Steps

- Initial project structure analysis
- Migration planning initiated
- Identified current .NET Framework version as 3.5
- Identified SQL Server 2008 database

### Next Steps

- Begin application assessment (Phase 2)
- Create detailed work breakdown structure for accelerated migration
- Set up development environment for .NET 8 migration
- Begin Azure Bicep template preparation for infrastructure

### Migration Phases

1. ✅ **Planning** (Current Phase)
   - Define migration goals and requirements
   - Create migration strategy
   - Set up tracking documents

2. ⬜ **Assessment**
   - Analyze application architecture
   - Identify dependencies
   - Evaluate cloud readiness
   - Create detailed assessment report

3. ⬜ **Code Modernization**
   - Upgrade framework version (.NET 3.5 to .NET 8)
   - Modernize dependencies
   - Refactor Web Forms to ASP.NET Core MVC (not Razor Pages)
   - Migrate all static assets (images, CSS, JS) to MVC structure
   - Update authentication to Entra ID and configuration

4. ⬜ **Infrastructure Generation**
   - Create Azure Bicep templates for App Service and related resources
   - Configure networking, security, and Entra ID integration
   - Set up Application Insights monitoring and logging
   - Implement disaster recovery and backup strategies

5. ⬜ **Deployment to Azure**
   - Deploy application to Azure environment
   - Validate functionality
   - Perform performance testing
   - Configure production environment

6. ⬜ **CI/CD Pipeline Setup**
   - Configure automated build pipeline
   - Set up deployment automation
   - Implement testing in pipeline
   - Configure monitoring and alerts

### Risks and Mitigation

- **Large version gap from .NET Framework 3.5 to .NET 8**
  - Mitigation: Adopt a phased conversion approach with focus on core functionality first
  
- **Web Forms to ASP.NET Core MVC transition complexity**
  - Mitigation: Create reusable component patterns to accelerate UI conversion
  - Mitigation: Develop an asset migration strategy for all images and static content
  - Mitigation: Maintain URL structure where possible to avoid broken links
  
- **Integration with existing Azure SQL Database**
  - Mitigation: Validate schema compatibility early; plan for any necessary schema migrations
  
- **Windows to Entra ID authentication migration**
  - Mitigation: Use Microsoft.Identity.Web library for streamlined integration
  
- **Accelerated timeline (ASAP)**
  - Mitigation: Prioritize features, establish clear milestones, use parallel work streams

### Notes

- Migration planning started on August 15, 2025
- Identified application as .NET Framework 3.5 with ASP.NET Web Forms
- Identified SQL Server 2008 database
- Target migration framework: .NET 8
- Target hosting platform: Azure App Service
- Target database: Existing Azure SQL Database
- Authentication: Migrate from Windows Authentication to Entra ID (Azure AD)
- Infrastructure as Code: Azure Bicep
- Timeline: ASAP - high priority
