## Project: BookShop Application Migration to Azure

### Current Status

- **Phase**: Phase 4 - Infrastructure Generation
- **Started**: August 15, 2025
- **Status**: In Progress

### Completed Steps

- Initial project structure analysis
- Migration planning completed
- Identified current .NET Framework version as 3.5
- Identified SQL Server 2008 database
- Defined migration requirements and strategy
- Selected Azure Bicep for infrastructure as code
- Finalized target framework as .NET 8
- Decided on ASP.NET Core MVC architecture
- Completed detailed assessment of application architecture
- Created inventory of Web Forms, components, and static assets
- Analyzed data access patterns and database requirements
- Developed risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Created detailed implementation roadmap
- Finalized static asset migration strategy
- Created new ASP.NET Core MVC project structure with Clean Architecture
- Implemented domain models with data annotations
- Set up Entity Framework Core with database-first approach
- Implemented repository pattern with EF Core
- Created application service layer with dependency injection
- Developed controllers and views for core functionality
- Implemented Entra ID authentication with Microsoft.Identity.Web
- Set up static asset structure in wwwroot
- Implemented health checks for system monitoring
- Created database initialization with sample data
- Successfully migrated book cover images from legacy application
- Enhanced sample data with additional authors, categories, and books
- Added customer, employee and order sample data for testing
- Created EF Core migration scripts for database schema
- Completed and tested all application views and functionality
- Created infrastructure as code using Azure Bicep
- Configured App Service, App Insights, and Key Vault resources
- Set up SQL database connection configuration
- Configured networking and security for Azure resources
- Prepared Entra ID integration scripts for authentication

### Next Steps

1. **Validate Infrastructure**
   - Validate the Bicep templates using Azure CLI
   - Test the infrastructure deployment in a sandbox environment
   - Document infrastructure deployment process
   - Review security best practices for the deployed resources

2. **Prepare for Azure Deployment**
   - Create resource group in target Azure subscription
   - Deploy infrastructure using Bicep templates
   - Configure Entra ID application registration
   - Set up connection strings and application settings
   
3. **Deployment Planning**
   - Create CI/CD pipeline definition for GitHub Actions
   - Prepare Azure subscription for deployment
   - Establish deployment verification tests
   - Define rollback procedures

### Migration Phases

1. ✅ **Planning**
   - Define migration goals and requirements
   - Create migration strategy
   - Set up tracking documents

2. ✅ **Assessment**
   - Analyze application architecture
   - Identify dependencies
   - Evaluate cloud readiness
   - Create detailed assessment report

3. ✅ **Code Modernization**
   - ✅ Upgrade framework version (.NET 3.5 to .NET 8)
   - ✅ Modernize dependencies
   - ✅ Implement EF Core database-first approach with existing Azure SQL database
   - ✅ Refactor Web Forms to ASP.NET Core MVC (not Razor Pages)
   - ✅ Migrate static assets (images, CSS, JS) to MVC structure
   - ✅ Update authentication to Entra ID
   - ✅ Implement health checks and database initialization
   - ✅ Create EF Core migrations for database schema
   - ✅ Enhance application with rich sample data
   - ✅ Complete remaining views and test end-to-end functionality

4. ✅ **Infrastructure Generation**
   - ✅ Create Azure Bicep templates for App Service and related resources
   - ✅ Configure networking, security, and Entra ID integration
   - ✅ Set up Application Insights monitoring and logging
   - ✅ Implement disaster recovery and backup strategies

5. ⬜ **Deployment to Azure** (Next Phase)
   - Deploy application to Azure environment
   - Validate functionality
   - Perform performance testing
   - Configure production environment

6. ⬜ **CI/CD Pipeline Setup**
   - Configure automated build pipeline
   - Set up deployment automation
   - Implement testing in pipeline
   - Configure monitoring and alerts

### Risks and Mitigation

- **Large version gap from .NET Framework 3.5 to .NET 8**
  - Mitigation: Adopt a phased conversion approach with focus on core functionality first
  
- **Web Forms to ASP.NET Core MVC transition complexity**
  - Mitigation: Create reusable component patterns to accelerate UI conversion
  - Mitigation: Develop an asset migration strategy for all images and static content
  - Mitigation: Maintain URL structure where possible to avoid broken links
  
- **Integration with existing Azure SQL Database**
  - Mitigation: Use EF Core database-first approach with existing schema
  - Mitigation: Test connection and data access early in the development process
  
- **Windows to Entra ID authentication migration**
  - Mitigation: Use Microsoft.Identity.Web library for streamlined integration
  
- **Accelerated timeline (ASAP)**
  - Mitigation: Prioritize features, establish clear milestones, use parallel work streams

### Notes

- Migration planning started on August 15, 2025
- Identified application as .NET Framework 3.5 with ASP.NET Web Forms
- Identified SQL Server 2008 database
- Target migration framework: .NET 8
- Target hosting platform: Azure App Service
- Target database: Existing Azure SQL Database
- Authentication: Migrate from Windows Authentication to Entra ID (Azure AD)
- Infrastructure as Code: Azure Bicep
- Timeline: ASAP - high priority
